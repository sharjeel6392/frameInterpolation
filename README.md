# AI powered frame interpolation.

# Description
We will be implementing multiple machine learning models. With 2 frames as input the output should be the frame in between. We will chose the model that performs the best.

# Applications
Often in cinematography movies are shot with a low frame rate( 24fps ) to cut down on cost. This compromises the smoothness of the resulting footage. This technology could help increase the frame rate of videos to make them look smoother.

# Dataset
We will create our own dataset by decomposing multiple videos into frames. We will make sure to include different types of videos (filmed, animated or computer generated). Since we are creating our own dataset, we have a third person in our group who will take care of all the dataset creation tasks.
